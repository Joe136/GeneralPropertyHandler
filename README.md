GeneralPropertyHandler
======================

This is an abstraction for the Microsoft Windows Property Handler System. The main goal is to implement Property Handlers easily and bind multiple types to one library.

Benefits:
 * independent of most Windows API characteristics
 * multiple handlers in one library (default)
 * independent of file suffix


Available Property Handlers
===========================

Currently a Vorbis Property Handler in read-only mode is implemented.


Installation
============

There is no installation system implemented. Look at this page to register the Handler:
